These notes intend to help people working on the Git version of
this package.

* Requirements

You need the following packages to build the Git version of GNU
cpio.  We do not make any efforts to accommodate older versions of
these packages, so please make sure that you have the latest stable
version. 

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>
- Git <http://git.or.cz>

* Bootstrapping

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to clone
cpio from Git. The next step is to get other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages: 

1. Change to the source tree directory

   cd cpio

2. Run

   ./bootstrap 

Once done, proceed as described in the file README (section
INSTALLATION).

Normally you will have to run bootstrap only once. However, if you
intend to hack on GNU cpio, you might need to run it again later.
There are several options that you may find useful in this case.
See 'bootstrap --help' for a detailed list.
